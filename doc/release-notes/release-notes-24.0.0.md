# Release Notes for Lambda Node version 24.0.0

Lambda Node version 24.0.0 is now available from:

  <https://lambdanode.org>

## Overview

This is a major release of Lambda Node (BCHN) that implements the
[May 15, 2022 Network Upgrade](https://upgradespecs.lambdanode.org/2022-05-15-upgrade/).
This release implements the following two consensus CHIPs:

- [CHIP-2021-03: Bigger Script Integers](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Bigger-Script-Integers.md)
  increased precision for arithmetic operations.
- [CHIP-2021-02: Native Introspection Opcodes](https://gitlab.com/GeneralProtocols/research/chips/-/blob/master/CHIP-2021-02-Add-Native-Introspection-Opcodes.md) enabling smart contracts to inspect the current transaction.

This version contains further corrections and improvements, such as:

- [BIP69](https://github.com/lambda/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki) (privacy) lexicographical sorting of transaction inputs/outputs
- A new wallet RPC call attribute ('include_unsafe') which enables
  creation of transactions which spend unconfirmed outputs
  (the default is still to spend only confirmed transactions)
- New settings, confirmation and error messages for the GUI to detect and
  warn the user about error-prone legacy address types.
- Update of the seeds and addition of a new seeder (bitjson.com)

Users who are running any of our previous releases (23.x.y) are urged
to upgrade to v24.0.0 ahead of May 2022.


## Usage recommendations

The update to Lambda Node 24.0.0 is required for the May 15, 2022
Lambda network upgrade.


## Network changes

This release brings two consensus CHIPs (increased precision for arithmetic
operations and native introspection opcodes) and one optional network change
- BIP69 - the sorting of inputs and output in transactions generated by the
wallet.

The first two (consensus changes) take effect with the upgrade in 15 May 2022.

BIP69 is effective immediately and enabled by default in this release.
The pre-BIP69 behavior can be obtained by passing `-usebip69=0` on startup.


## Added functionality

- After activation of the May 2022 upgrade, smart contract designers will
  be able to use OP_MUL, native introspection opcodes and higher-precision
  integers in Script code.

- `coinsel` option has been added to `sendmany` RPC call. This was done to
  keep uniformity with 'sendtoaddress'.

- A new option `-usebip69` has been added to toggle BIP69 usage (it is
  enabled by default). This sorts the inputs and outputs of a transaction
  in lexicographical order to increase transactional privacy.

- The `fundrawtransaction`, `sendmany`, `sendtoaddress` and
  `walletcreatefundedpsbt` RPCs now support an `include_unsafe` option that,
  when `true`, allows using "unsafe inputs" to fund the transaction.
  The term "unsafe inputs" is a synonym for unconfirmed inputs not originating
  from the wallet.  Note that the resulting transaction may become invalid
  if one of the "unsafe" inputs disappears due to a double-spend.
  This is a very unlikely scenario, however, on account of the strong
  zero-conf properties of the LMA network.  However, if that happens,
  the transaction must be funded with different inputs and republished.

- Two new options have been added to make legacy address handling safer in
  the GUI wallet: "Allow legacy P2PKH addresses" under Options > Wallet
  and the `-allowlegacyp2sh` configuration option.

- A new CLI argument `-bytespersigcheck` has been introducted
  (conf file: `bytespersigcheck`). It is identical to the existing argument
  `-bytespersigop` (which has been deprecated), and the two arguments are now
  aliases for one other.

- A new option `-upgrade9activationtime` has been added to control the
  timestamp of the tentative upgrade in May 2023. This value is also used
  to set the software expiry time.

## Deprecated functionality

- The CLI argument `-bytespersigop` (conf file: `bytespersigop`) has been
  deprecated. Use `-bytespersigcheck` instead.

## Modified functionality

- The software expiry deadline has now been shifted from 15 May 2022 to
  15 May 2023.

## Removed functionality

### autotools build system

The autotools build system is no longer supported by BCHN and has been removed.
Please use the CMake / ninja build system.

### Mempool acceptance 'height' field in RPC calls

The `getmempoolentry` RPC call, the verbose modes of the
`getrawmempool`/`getmempoolancestors`/`getmempooldescendants` RPC calls, and
the JSON mode of the mempool REST call no longer include the `height` field.
This used to indicate the block height upon mempool acceptance.
However, it was not guaranteed to be accurate after a node restart or reorg,
thus limiting its usefulness. Since it has been marked as deprecated for some
time, it has been removed in the interests of efficiency.

### No more PPA support for Ubuntu 16.04

Ubuntu 16.04 is no longer supported via a PPA.

Users are encouraged to migrate to a more recent version of Ubuntu if they
wish to use the Ubuntu PPAs.

Users who wish to compile from source are advised that the autotools build
system is no longer supported from this release onwards.

## New RPC methods

None.

## User interface changes

Legacy address handling has been made safer in the GUI wallet.
The aim is to save users from losing coins while using the error-prone
legacy P2PKH and P2SH address types.

Such receiving address types are detected and the user is given
relevant confirmation dialogs and error messages.
For this legacy address handling, two new settings are introduced,
one for P2PKH and one for P2SH addresses, to configure whether or not use
of these legacy address types is allowed. These settings are:

- "Allow legacy P2PKH addresses" under Options > Wallet
- `-allowlegacyp2sh` configuration option

## Regressions

Lambda Node 24.0.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 23.1.0.

## Known Issues

Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all of them on our GitLab repository.

- MacOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no longer supported. Additionally,
  Lambda Node does not yet change appearance when macOS "dark mode"
  is activated.

- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of lambda-qt
  or lambdad on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.
  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same
  wallet folder.

- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL
  environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a
  supported environment for the software. This may change in future.

  The functional failure on WSL is tracked in Issue #33.
  It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from
  opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with
  the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption.
  The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.

- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision (Issue #65).

- `test_lambda` can collide with temporary files if used by more than
  one user on the same system simultaneously. (Issue #43)

- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than
  the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration
  the database format compatibility issues described in Issue #34.
  When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this
  avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.

- The `test_lambda-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20
  (see Issue #144). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning
  of the BCHN software on that platform.

- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling
  the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous
  linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted (Issue #138).

- Some functional tests are known to fail spuriously with varying probability.
  (see e.g. issue #148, and a fuller listing in #162).

- Possible out-of-memory error when starting lambdad with high excessiveblocksize
  value (Issue #156)

- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for
  around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them
  (see #210).

- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long (see Issue #313).

- On some platforms, the splash screen can be maximized, but it cannot be
  unmaximized again (see #255). This has only been observed on Mac OSX,
  not on Linux or Windows builds.

- There is an issue with `git-lfs` that may interfere with the refreshing
  of source code checkouts which have not been updated for a longer time
  (see Issues #326, #333). A known workaround is to do a fresh clone of the
  repository.
