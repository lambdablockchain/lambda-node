Lambda Node
=====================

Intro
-----
Lambda is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run lambda-qt.exe.

Lambda Node is based on Lambda ABC, which is an original Lambda client and
builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and stores the entire history
of Lambda transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to
a day or more.
